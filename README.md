# Teluino, O Bot
Teluino is a Telegram Bot to communicate with my Arduino.


As I lost so much time trying the wifi module works, I resolved use serial
communication for a while.


The objective is create a communication with the Arduino and Telegram and play a
little with them. I'm trying to use TDD to develop everything.
